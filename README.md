# SQL-Queries-for-Student-Registration-System
This project is created in order to apply statements of desired changings in the student registration system. Those 12 statements can be seen in project description file.
There are 12 statements in this project and I am asked to write one or more SQL queries for each statement. Your query should take into consideration that the tuples currently in the database may change. In other words, your query must be correct for any valid state of every table.
